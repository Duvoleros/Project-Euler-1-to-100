# Project-Euler-1-to-100
My own solutions for the first 100 problems of popular Project Euler initiative.

Problems were completed from year 2022 to 2024. The initial goal of the action was to get familiar with Python syntax, later I found math-based problems, aided with sophisticated calculations amusing hobby and switched to my prime programming language C++. Problems vary in instruments used and code style, I'm planning to unify them in the nearest future.
Code for other solved problems would be kept private, as is stated in PE materials distribution regulations.
